    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect only the data necessary to enhance user experience and ensure the app's functionality. Specifically,
        we collect:</p>
    <ul>

            technical issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics Data:</strong> Data gathered through Firebase Analytics to understand how users engage
            with the app, including screen views, in-app events, and other usage patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>Push Notifications:</strong> We may send push notifications to inform users about updates, new
